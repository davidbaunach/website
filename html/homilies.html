				<p style="color:white; text-align: left; font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">
				We need to have a little history lesson to understand the meaning for today's feast of Mary, the Mother of God. And this complicated lessons starts in the middle of the third century AD, when the Greek term for Mother of God: Theotokos, starts to appear. Mary is Theotokos, the Mother of God, because her son Jesus is one person who is both God and man, divine and human. This did not become formally defined by the Church until the Council of Ephesus in the year 431, but the term was in use at least one hundred years earlier. <br>
				<br>
				One thing to know about Church history, is we usually don't formally define things, unless a heresy comes around first and makes it necessary. In this case, the heresy was Nestorianism, started by the archbishop of Constatintinople: Nestorius. He denied Mary the title of Theotokos, and to do so, had to split apart the divinity and humanity of Jesus, so that Mary was only the mother of the humanity of Jesus, the Christotokos. This direct attack upon the hypostatic union, which holds that Jesus is fully divine and fully human, was the main problem, but out of it grew the problem of seeing Mary as just the mother of a part of Jesus. Which is another thing to note: get one things wrong in Christianity, and other things will go wrong as well. Error begets more error. <br>
				<br>
				To wrap up the history lesson: Nestorianism was growing in popularity, it was easier for people to grasp than the intricacies of the hypostatic union, and so the Council of Ephesus was convened. Nestorius was declared a heretic, removed from being archbishop of Constatinople, the hypostatic union of Christ was reaffirmed, and Mary was declared Theotokos. <br>
				<br>
				Now, what to do with all this information? As our Gospel says: Mary kept all these things, reflecting on them in her heart. It is an act of humility, to accept that some aspects of our faith, are difficult to comprehend and understand. But then it is an act of courage, to at least attempt to understand them. To do the research, to learn, and to keep all those things, reflecting on them in our hearts.

				<p style="color:white; text-align: left; font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">
				There are two lessons that Christmas teaches us. <br>
				The first, is pay attention to the small things. <br>
				/ <br>
				We have a tiny newborn, born to insignificant parents, in a backwater town, on an ordinary day. <br>
			
				But that tiny newborn, was the King of the Universe. <br>
			
				/ <br>
			
				His first visitors where shepherds, a class of men ignored and avoided. <br>
			
				And he led a life so ordinary, that besides an inscedent at the temple, nothing more is said about it until Jesus began his public ministry. <br>
			
				// <br>
			
				When we look for God, we do well to look to the small things. <br>
			
				The cry of a child. <br>
			
				The plea of a beggar. <br>
			
				The streets of a small town. <br>
			
				The tiny whispering voice. <br>
			
				//// <br>
			
				But then comes the second lesson: be on the lookout for angels! <br>
			
				For God comes to us as an infant, but that arrival, was announced by heavenly messangers. <br>
			
				Terrifying supernatural beings of light. <br>
			
				Appearing to Mary and Joseph. <br>
			
				Appearing to those shepherds. <br>
			
				// <br>
			
				God breaks into our world in tiny and seemingly insignificant ways. <br>
			
				But the spiritual significance of those little actions, is invaluable. <br>
			
				That is why the angels show up: to give some indication that what is happening, is beyond our comprehension. <br>
			 
				//// <br>
			
				May we take with us these Christmas lessons: <br>
			
				To look for God in the tiny and insignificant events of daily life. <br>
			
				And prepare yourselves, to see angels!</p>
