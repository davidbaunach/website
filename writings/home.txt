HOME
Year: 2025

I love being home. Mom and Dad don't get as much done as they used to, but there are still chickens in the coop, a garden well planted with flowers and vegetables, bees in the beehive, and after dinner, Dad fills the house with music, as he always has. Tonight, he's playing the accordian.

Despite differences of opinion and conviction, the island of of peace they attempt to carve out of this turbulant world, is one of the many reasons they have my respect and appreciation.

A love of growing things, an appreciation for a simple and sustainable life, attempting to heal the deep wounds they both recieved in childhood, finding bounty in the midst of a frugal existence.

But then I remember the bad things, they assault my mind.

Which is as it must be, in this realm of the fallen.
