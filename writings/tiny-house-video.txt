A tiny house vid that touches on a lot of topics

I've watched this video (even though it's a whole hour) at least 4 times. It's a walkthrough of Brad Kittel's tiny house building operation, filmed in 2014. This eccentric gentleman has a wealth of knowledge on the materials he salvaged, sustainability and resource stewardship, house building methodologies, and whole bunch of other stuff.

Major thoughts prompted by this video: necessity of living small, keeping minimal possessions, which leads to a richer life in human interaction, spending as much time outdoors as possible, seeking a depth of knowledge in your field of expertise, and being creative to avoid government overreach [-:
