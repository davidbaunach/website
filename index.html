			There are two lessons that Christmas teaches us. <br>
			The first, is pay attention to the small things. <br>
			/ <br>
			We have a tiny newborn, born to insignificant parents, in a backwater town, on an ordinary day. <br>
			
			But that tiny newborn, was the King of the Universe. <br>
			
			/ <br>
			
			His first visitors where shepherds, a class of men ignored and avoided. <br>
			
			And he led a life so ordinary, that besides an inscedent at the temple, nothing more is said about it until Jesus began his public ministry. <br>
			
			// <br>
			
			When we look for God, we do well to look to the small things. <br>
			
			The cry of a child. <br>
			
			The plea of a beggar. <br>
			
			The streets of a small town. <br>
			
			The tiny whispering voice. <br>
			
			//// <br>
			
			But then comes the second lesson: be on the lookout for angels! <br>
			
			For God comes to us as an infant, but that arrival, was announced by heavenly messangers. <br>
			
			Terrifying supernatural beings of light. <br>
			
			Appearing to Mary and Joseph. <br>
			
			Appearing to those shepherds. <br>
			
			// <br>
			
			God breaks into our world in tiny and seemingly insignificant ways. <br>
			
			But the spiritual significance of those little actions, is invaluable. <br>
			
			That is why the angels show up: to give some indication that what is happening, is beyond our comprehension. <br>
			 
			//// <br>
			
			May we take with us these Christmas lessons: <br>
			
			To look for God in the tiny and insignificant events of daily life. <br>
			
			And prepare yourselves, to see angels!</p>
